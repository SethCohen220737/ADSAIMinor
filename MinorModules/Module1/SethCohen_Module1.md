# Module 1: Philosophy AI & Information Literacy

## 3.1a

Artificial Intelligence = Learning algorithms, a system that learns and improves as it goes. It is learning to be intelligient, and perhaps it is.

# Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence


## 2.2a

Strong AI -> Possessing generlized intelligience on par with human recognition
Weak AI = Excels at specialized tasks, but lacks common sense and awareness

## 2.2b

Giving someone or something the tools to produce an adequarte answer without grasping the meaning of the answer, but still being able to tell you that it is correct. 

Chinese Room = Give a person a chinese manual and he will reply in chinese. He will not be able to grasp and truly understand the language but he will be able to reply correctly. 

## 2.2c

B, it requires grasping of meaning. The experiment, as they say, shows that the machine able to 'manipulate symbols'. A simulation of understanding. 


## 2.2e 

Yes and no. It still learns to some extent, although the definition of learning might be quite different from what we would expect.
However, it is more a simulated learning/understanding, it doesnt improve and grasp the meaning of what it is learning.

## 3c

Overall, the pretty stark difference is the way the paper is written. The scholarly paper had a questioning undertone, while the popular source is very confident and certain. 

There are no sources mentioned in the Popular Source, it is also shorter, more concise and frankly an 'easier read'.

Using ChatGPT-5 mini, I generated a concise summary of the scholarly article to identify the key challenges of human-like agents in virtual game environments.*

**Summary:**

The paper "The Many Challenges of Human-Like Agents in Virtual Game Environments" by Świechowski and Ślęzak (2025) discusses the complexities of creating AI agents that mimic human behavior in video games. It identifies 13 key challenges, including the diversity of human playstyles and the need for agents to exhibit imperfections. The authors also present an empirical study using a deep recurrent convolutional neural network to distinguish human players from bots in a tactical video game, highlighting the difficulty in creating truly human-like AI.

Using ChatGPT-5 mini, I generated a concise summary of the article to explain the main concepts and challenges of human-like agents in virtual game environments.*

**Text (max 100 words):**

Human-like agents in virtual game environments aim to replicate the behaviors and decision-making of real players. Creating such agents is challenging due to the diversity of human playstyles, the need for unpredictability, and the requirement to exhibit imperfections. Machine learning and deep neural networks can model certain patterns, but distinguishing genuine human behavior from AI remains complex. Effective design requires careful consideration of adaptability, learning, and interaction within dynamic game settings. These agents are crucial for testing game mechanics, enhancing player experience, and advancing research in artificial intelligence. (ChatGPT-5 mini, Enterprise, 04-09-2025)
