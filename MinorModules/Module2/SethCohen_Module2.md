# Module 2: A Day in a Life of â€¦

## 2.2a

I found some tasks that a Data Scientist would do. I have made them a bit more concise. 

- Working with algorithms
- Data-driven predictions
- Exploring, visualizing, cleaning and analyizing data. 
- Recognizing patterns in data for solving problems 
- Documenting steps taken, reporting and sharing insights. 
- Develop Data Models

## This is a timeline I found on a website

- **9:00 AM** - Team huddle for the distribution of the task.
- **9:30 AM** - Explore and go in-depth with data analysis: refine models, crunch numbers, and test new algorithms.
- **Noon** - Lunch break.
- **1:00 PM** - Meeting with stakeholders to discuss insights and recommendations.
- **3:00 PM** - Work on data visualization, and preparing reports.
- **4:30 PM** - Collaborate with the engineering team to implement new features.
- **6:00 PM** - Wind up for the day, perhaps reading up on the latest in the field.

Another possible timeline: 

- **9:00 AM** - Morning priorities, check on on-going models 
- **9:30 AM** - Meetings
- **10:30 AM** - Modelling & Data Processing
- **Noon** - Lunch break.
- **1:00 PM** - Presentation of insights
- **3:00 PM** - Iteration & Validation
- **4:30 PM** - Planning ahead for future models, and writing up documentation
