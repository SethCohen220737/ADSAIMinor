## Module 3: History of AI & GitHub

## 2.1a

Wouldnt say its the most 'creative' answer to the question, but I would highlight the defeat of Garry Kasparov against IBM's Deep Blue. 

Which was the first computer to defeat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov in a match under standard tournament rules. This was a breakthrough because chess had long been seen as a test of human intellect and strategy. 

This was a turning point in showcasing that machines could handle decision-making in real time.

## 2.2b

**Procedure** 

A human interrogator, communicates via written messages with 2 participants, one actual person, one machine. The interrogator's task is to determine which of the 2 participants is human, and which is a machine based on their responses. The machines job is to act human, and fool the interrogator. 

**Objective**

The main objective of the game is to see whether the machine is able to show intelligent behaviour that is a near perfect match to an actual human, without anyone knowing better. It is a test for artifical intelligience.

Both have been completed as evidenced by the markdown file that you are reading, taken from github.
